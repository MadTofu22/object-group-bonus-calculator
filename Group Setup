What do you hope to get out of this project:
    Tom - Completion and broader knowledge of working together.
    Travis - Completion and broader understanding syntax.

What do you do when you're stressed:
    Travis - Get quiet and live in own head. Divert from acknowledging I'm stressed.
    Tom - Try to push harder to be understood and not realize I'm just wrong and/or stressed. Divert from acknowledging I'm stressed.

What Seems the most difficult about this project:
    Travis - Difference in skill set, and dealing with imposter syndrome.
    Tom - Difference in skill set, wanting to move along at my own pace.

What was hard for you a few weeks ago, but now you feel confident with it?
    Tom - Accepting I'm not an imposter and that my skill set is just the level I'm at and not something to compare to others.
    Travis - Reaching out for help because I didn't want to annoy others and fear of perception.
